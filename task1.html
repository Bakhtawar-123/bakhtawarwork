      <h2>Why to learn HTML?</h2>
      <p>Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists,<br> and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.</p>
      <p>HTML is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.<br> I will list down some of the key advantages of learning HTML:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create Web site - You can create a website or customize an existing web template if you know HTML well.</li>
        <li>Become a web designer - If you want to start a carrer as a professional web designer, HTML and CSS designing is a must skill.</li>
        <li>Understand web - If you want to optimize your website, to boost its speed and performance, it is good to know HTML to yield best results.</li>
        <li>Learn other languages - Once you understands the basic of HTML then other related technologies like javascript, php, or angular are become easier to understand.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>APPLICATIONS OF HTML</h1>
      <p>As mentioned before, HTML is one of the most widely used language over the web.<br> I'm going to list few of them here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Web pages development - HTML is used to create pages which are rendered over the web. Almost every page of web is having html tags in it to render its details in browser.</li>
        <li>Internet Navigation - HTML provides tags which are used to navigate from one page to another and is heavily used in internet navigation.</li>
        <li>Responsive UI - HTML pages now-a-days works well on all platform, mobile, tabs, desktop or laptops owing to responsive design strategy.</li>
        <li>Offline support HTML pages once loaded can be made available offline on the machine without any need of internet.</li>
        <li>Game development- HTML5 has native support for rich experience and is now useful in gaming developent arena as well.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>HTML Version timeline</h1>
      <h3>HTML2</h3>
      <p>November 24, 1995 <br>
HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)</li>
        <li>May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)</li>
        <li>August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)</li>
        <li>January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>HTML 3</h3>
      <p>January 14, 1997
HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[16]
Initially code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[13] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.
</p>
    <h3>HTML 4</h3>
    <p>HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
      <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
      <li>Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[19]</p>
    <br>
    <p>April 24, 1998
HTML 4.0[20] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
December 24, 1999
HTML 4.01[21] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.
May 2000
ISO/IEC 15445:2000[22][23] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).[22]
After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.</p>
  <h3>HTML 5</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>October 28, 2014:
HTML5[24] was published as a W3C Recommendation</li>
<li>November 1, 2016:
HTML 5.1[26] was published as a W3C Recommendation.</li>
<li>December 14, 2017:
HTML 5.2[29] was published as a W3C Recommendation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2011 HTML5</h3>
  <p>On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.[49] In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continues its project to release HTML5.</p>
  <h3>2012 HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation</h3>
  <p>In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.[51]
In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.[52] The criterion for advancement to W3C Recommendation is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations"</p>
<h3>2014 HTML5 – Proposed Recommendation and Recommendation</h3>
<p>In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.[54]
On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation,[55] meaning the specification process is complete.[</p>
<h3>XHTML versions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>XHTML 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on January 26, 2000,[57] and was later revised and republished on August 1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.</li>
  <li>XHTML 1.1[58] was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but includes minor changes, can be customized, and is reformulated using modules in the W3C recommendation "Modularization of XHTML", which was published on April 10, 2001.</li>
  <li>XHTML 2.0 was a working draft, work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on HTML5 and XHTML5.[60][61][62] XHTML 2.0 was incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than an update to XHTML 1.x.</li>
  <li>An XHTML syntax, known as "XHTML5.1", is being defined alongside HTML5 in the HTML5 draft</li>
